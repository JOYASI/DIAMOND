1. setup database to store all data and retrieve from there
    -> FeedView
    -> SearchView
    
2. search bar in the search for job section

3. search for jobs tableview -> tick and bookmark thing isn't working properly yet

4. profile page whole design process -> including logout segway
    -> has to show bookmarked jobs and so on
    

//Ideas
Was thinking of maybe doing a swiping thing like tinder so the user can swipe on jobs and those that they like end up in their saved/bookmarked.
